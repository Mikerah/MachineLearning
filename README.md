# Overview
This is a repository where I attempt to implement various machine learning algorithms as a complement to a course in machine learning that I am currently taking. I don't feel like I truly understand these methods until I try to implement them myself. So, I decided to create this repository. I will try to update this repository regularly.

## Implemented
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Simple Linear Regression

## To Implement
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
